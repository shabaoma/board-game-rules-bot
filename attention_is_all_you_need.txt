OBJECT OF THE GAME

MAIN OBJECTIVE CARDS

In Dead of Winter, players are a colony of survivors trying
to survive a hazardous winter in the aftermath of the
zombie apocalypse. The colony has an objective they are
trying to complete, but each player also controls a group
of survivors that has a secret objective. Often this secret
objective requires that a player help complete the colony
objective. Only players who have completed their secret
objective when the game ends will win. The game can end
in a variety of ways: If the morale track reaches 0, if the
round track reaches 0, or if the main objective is completed.

ROUND ORDER
Dead of Winter is played over a series of rounds. Each round
is divided into 2 phases that must be played in order.
1. Player Turns Phase
2. Colony Phase

PLAYER TURNS PHASE
During the player turns phase resolve the following 3
effects in order.
1. Reveal Crisis: Reveal the top card of the crisis deck. This
card’s effect will take place during the colony phase
if it is not prevented. Crisis cards can be prevented if
players contribute enough of the correct type of cards
to that crisis.
2. Roll Action Dice: At this time each player removes any
action dice remaining in her used and unused action
dice pool. Then each player receives 1 action die, plus
1 additional action die for each survivor she controls
(so players will start the game with 3 action dice). Each
player must roll all of her action dice and keep the
results in her unused action dice pool for use during
her turn. Even though a player receives 1 action die per
survivor she controls, the action die does not belong to
that survivor, but to that player’s group of survivors. A
player can spend multiple action dice on performing
multiple actions with a single survivor.
3. Player Turns: During the player turn phase, each player
starting with the first player will take a turn. At the
beginning of a player’s turn the player to her right draws
a crossroads card (applying its effects to the player taking
the turn if, at anytime during that turn, they meet the
trigger requirement). On a player’s turn she may perform
multiple actions. Once a player has performed all of the
actions she wishes (or if she runs out of actions she is
able to perform) on her turn, play passes to the player on
her left. Play will continue clockwise around the table
until each player has taken a turn. Once each player
has taken a turn the player turns phase is over and the
colony phase begins.

8

PLAYER TURN ACTIONS
Some actions require spending an action die and others
do not. To spend an action die, a player removes the
appropriate die from his unused action die pool and moves
it to his used action die pool. Some actions require that the
action die be a specific result (from having rolled it during
the roll action dice step).

Actions that require an Action Die
• Attack: To perform an attack, a player must choose a
survivor he controls and spend an action die equal to or
higher than the attack value of that survivor. That player
may then choose a target for that attack. The target must
be a zombie or a survivor that shares a location with the
attacking survivor.
If a zombie is chosen, kill it and remove it from the game
board. Roll for exposure on the survivor that attacked
(see Rolling for Exposure on page 11 for details). See
Example: Attacking a Zombie on page 9.
If a survivor is chosen, roll the spent action die. If the result
is equal to or less than the chosen survivor’s attack value
place a wound marker on the chosen survivor and take a
card at random from the hand of the player that controls
that survivor. See Example: Attacking a Survivor on page 9.

Note: The exposure die is not rolled when attacking another
survivor.

“ Everybody quiet! Did
anyone else hear that? I said
be quiet! There it is. Yeah,
we’re not alone. They must
have heard the truck pull
up. You two keep searching,
and I’ll draw them off and
try to drop a couple. You
guys better find something to
make this worthwhile.”

controls. A player cannot attack a helpless survivor.
• Search: A player can search at any location except the

• make noise by placing a noise token on an empty
noise space at his location to draw and look at an
additional card. He may draw additional cards as
long as there are still empty noise spaces for the
corresponding noise tokens.
When the player has decided he has made enough noise
or can no longer make any more noise, he must keep 1 of
the drawn cards, adding it to his hand, and place the rest

spent must meet or exceed that number in order for it to be
used. A player may use the same survivor’s ability multiple
times in a single turn, unless the ability says otherwise.
An action die equal to or higher than the ability’s number
must be spent each time it is used.

Actions that do not require an Action Die
• Play a Card: As many times as he likes during his turn, a
player may play a card from his hand. To play a card,
place it on top of the waste pile.

Reminder: For every 10 cards in the waste pile during the check
waste step the colony will lose 1 morale.
A card with an equip ability is not placed in the waste
pile, instead a player may equip it to any survivor he
controls by placing that card next to that survivor.
That survivor now has the effect listed on that item
card. Once a card is equipped it cannot be unequipped
unless it is being added to a crisis or is being handed
off. If a survivor with 1 or more equipped cards dies
at the colony the equipped cards are added back to
the controlling player’s hand. If a survivor with 1 or
more equipped cards dies at a non-colony location the
equipped cards are shuffled into that location’s item deck.
A player can only play cards during his turn.

• Add a Card to the Crisis: A player may add 1 or more
cards from his hand and/or cards that are equipped to
survivors he controls to the currently revealed crisis
card. Cards added to a crisis from a player’s hand are
added face down so that no other player can see them.
Adding cards that match a symbol shown in the prevent
area of the crisis card helps to prevent that crisis from
happening. Each card added that does not match a
symbol helps cause the crisis to happen.

ROLLING FOR EXPOSURE

Note: Some food cards add multiple food tokens to the food
supply when they are played. Those food cards still only count
as 1 card played into the crisis.

Blank: Nothing happens.

• Move a Survivor: A Player may move each survivor he
controls once during his turn. A survivor may be
moved to any location that has an empty survivor
space. After each time a player moves a survivor, he
must roll for exposure.

Note: If the result of rolling for exposure was a bitten, when it is
spread it spreads to a survivor in the location that the moved
survivor just moved to.
• Spend Food Tokens: A player may spend 1 or
more food tokens by removing them from the
food supply area on the colony board. That
player increases any 1 unused action die he
controls by 1 for every food token he spends.
• Request: During his turn a player may request 1 or more
item cards from other players. Other players may give
the requesting player an item card from their hand, if
they do, that card must be revealed and immediately
played. The requested card cannot be added to the crisis.
• Hand Off: During his turn a player may have a survivor
he controls that has an item equipped hand that item
off to another survivor at the same location. When an
item is handed off it is unequipped from the survivor
that is handing it off and is immediately equipped to the
survivor that it is being handed to.

Note: If the item has a once per round ability and it has already
been used that round it cannot be used again by handing it off to
another survivor.
• Vote to Exile: Once during each of his turns a player
may choose another player and initiate a vote to
exile that player. Initiating a vote forces all players to
simultaneously cast a vote of yes (thumbs up) or no
(thumbs down) to determine whether or not the chosen
player is exiled. A player cannot initiate a vote to exile
themselves. Remember all ties are broken by the first
player, this includes votes to exile (see the Exile section
on page 14 for details).

Immediately after a survivor moves to a new
location or kills a zombie, the player that
controls that survivor must roll for exposure by rolling
this die. Each die face has an effect that is triggered when
that result is rolled.

Effects

Wound: The survivor receives 1 wound token.
Frostbite: The survivor receives 1 frostbite wound
token. This is considered a wound. At the
beginning of each of your turns, each survivor you
control that has 1 or more frostbite wound tokens
on it receives an additional wound token.

Bitten: The survivor is killed and the bite effect
spreads.

Spreading a Bite Effect
When a survivor is killed as a result of a bitten roll, the bite
effect spreads to the survivor with the lowest influence
that shared a location with the bitten survivor. Each time
a bite effect spreads, the player that controls the survivor it
spread to must choose from the following options:
• Option 1: Kill the survivor that the bite effect spread to.
The bite effect stops spreading.
• Option 2: Roll the exposure die again. On a blank result,
the survivor that the bite effect spread to is not killed
and the bite effect stops spreading. On any other result,
the survivor that the bite effect spread to is killed and the
bite effect spreads again. The bite effect will continue to
spread until a player either chooses option 1, rolls a blank
result after choosing option 2, or there are no
more survivors at the location.

Remember: Whenever a survivor
is killed by any game effect the
colony loses 1 morale.

movie material, but as people go, he
was a good one. I shall miss him.)

RESOLVING CROSSROADS CARDS
At the beginning of each player’s
turn, the player to her right will
draw a crossroads card. That
player must keep the crossroads
card secret, only revealing it if its
trigger happens. The text on that
card applies to the player taking a
turn. If at any time on the player’s
turn she meets the requirements
of the trigger, all of the card’s text
is read aloud by the player who
drew it. Most crossroads cards provide 2 options to choose
from, all of the text from these options is read out loud.
The player the card applies to must then choose 1 of the
options. That option immediately takes effect and the card
is removed from the game. If the card doesn’t trigger, place
it on the bottom of the crossroads deck. If a player is unable
to meet the conditions of an option on a crossroads card,
she must choose the other option.

Note: Some crossroads cards trigger when a player performs an
action. This trigger takes place after the action being taken has
been resolved.
Note: Some crossroads effects have you search a deck for a specific
card. After searching a deck, shuffle it.

Example: REsolving a crisis

1. During a three player game, the
Fuel Shortage crisis is resolved.
None of the three players
have been exiled, so a total of
3 points must be obtained to
prevent the crisis.

COLONY PHASE
During the colony phase, resolve the following 7 effects in
order.
1. Pay Food: Remove 1 food token from the food supply
for every 2 survivors in the colony (rounded up).
Remember that helpless survivor tokens count as
survivors for this purpose.

Note: Survivors at locations other than the colony do not count
towards the total number of survivors in the colony. They are
considered to be foraging food for themselves and so do not
require food be paid from the supply.
If there are not enough food tokens do the following in
order:
• Do not remove any food tokens.
• Add a starvation token to the food supply.
• Decrease morale by 1 for each starvation token
currently in the food supply.
2. Check Waste: Count the cards in the waste pile. For every
10 cards (rounded down), decrease morale by 1.
3. Resolve Crisis: Shuffle the cards that were added face-down
to the crisis during the player turns phase. Reveal them
one at a time. Each item card added that has a symbol
matching a symbol in the prevent section of the crisis
is worth 1 point. Each card that doesn’t have a symbol
matching a symbol in the prevent section of the crisis
subtracts 1 point. After revealing all of the cards, if
the combined point total is lower than the number
of players then immediately resolve the crisis. If the
point total equals or exceeds the number of players
the crisis is prevented. Additionally, if the point total
exceeds the number of players by 2 or more the colony
gains 1 morale. After resolving the crisis, remove all
cards added to the crisis from the game. See Example:
Resolving a Crisis to left.
4. Add Zombies: Add 1 zombie to the colony for every 2
survivors (including helpless survivors) present there
(rounded up). Add 1 zombie to each non-colony location
for every 1 survivor present at that location. One at a
time remove each noise token at a location and roll an
action die for each. Add a zombie to that location on
each roll of 3 or lower (see Adding Zombies on next page
for details on adding zombies to the colony).
5. Check Main Objective: Check to see if the goal on the main
objective has been achieved. If it has been achieved the
game immediately ends.

6. Move Round Tracker: Move the round tracker down 1
space on the round track. If it is moved onto 0 the game
immediately ends.
7. Pass First Player Token: The first player passes the first
player token to the player on his right. A new round
begins starting with the reveal crisis section of the
player turns phase.

Exam ple: Adding zombies

ADDING ZOMBIES

1
2

Whenever adding zombies, they are added 1 at a time until
all zombies that need to be added have been added.
When adding zombies to the colony, always place the first
zombie on any empty space in entrance 1, the second zombie
on any empty space in entrance 2, the third zombie on any
empty space in entrance 3, etc. until all of the zombies that
need to be added have been placed. When adding a seventh
zombie, place it on any empty space in entrance 1 again, an
eighth zombie on any empty space in entrance 2, etc. If there
are no empty entrance spaces in the entrance the zombie
would be placed but there is a barricade token in one of
those spaces, destroy that barricade token and remove the
zombie that would have been placed. If there are no empty
spaces and no barricade tokens, the entrance has been
overrun, remove that zombie and kill the survivor at the
colony that has the lowest influence value. If there are only
helpless survivors at the colony, kill a helpless survivor. If
there are no survivors at the colony remove the zombie that
would have been placed without further effect. Every time a
survivor is killed (including a helpless survivor), decrease
morale by 1. When adding zombies to non-colony locations
follow all of the same rules, except there is only 1 entrance to
place zombies in so all of the zombies are placed in spaces at
that entrance. See Example: Adding Zombies to right.

7

4

1. During the Add Zombies phase, there are fourteen
survivors in the colony so seven zombies need to be added
to the colony. The first zombie is placed on an empty
space in entrance 1.
2. Continuing counter-clockwise, next zombie is placed on
an empty space in entrance 2,

In the rare case that players ever have to
add zombies and there are no more zombie
standees left, use the zombie tokens included
in the game to add the additional zombies.

3. The third zombie would be placed in entrance 3 but
entrance 3 is already full of zombies. Entrance 3 is
therefore overrun. The zombie that would be placed is
not placed and the survivor at the colony that has the
lowest influence value is killed.

KILLING ZOMBIES

4. Continuing counter-clockwise, the fourth zombie is then
placed on an empty space in entrance 4.

Whenever a zombie is attacked it is killed. Whenever a
zombie is killed by an attack or card effect, the player
that controls the survivor that killed that zombie must
roll for exposure on that survivor. When killing a zombie
at the colony, choose which zombie to kill. It may come
from any entrance. A zombie that is killed or otherwise
removed from the game board is placed back into the pile
of unused zombies.

5. Continuing counter-clockwise, the fifth is placed on an
empty space in entrance 5
6. Continuing counter-clockwise, the sixth is placed on an
empty space in entrance 6.
7. Continuing counter-clockwise, the seventh and final
zombie is placed on an empty space in entrance 1.

ADDING SURVIVORS

EXILE

Some game effects will cause a player to add a new
survivor to her following. Whenever a survivor is added
to the game, its corresponding standee is added to the
“Colony Occupants” section of the colony board. The
player who controls the new survivor may use that
survivor during her turn, but does not roll an additional
action die for it until the roll action dice step of the
player turns phase. If there are no empty survivor spaces
remaining at the colony, then players cannot trigger
crossroads cards that would add survivors (including
helpless survivors) and cannot play item cards that would
add survivors.

If the players vote in favor of exiling a
player, the exiled player must immediately draw 1 exiled secret objective card.
This card will adjust his secret objective.
The exiled player must move all of the
survivors he controls that are in the
colony to non-colony locations of his
choice. Those survivors follow all of
the normal rules for movement, except this move does not
count as the 1 move survivors are allowed to make during
his turn. Some new rules apply to the exiled player:

KILLING SURVIVORS
• When zombies overrun a location entrance a survivor
is killed.

• The exiled player cannot add cards to a crisis.
• When the exiled player is directed to add helpless
survivor tokens to the colony those tokens are not added.
• If the exiled player plays a survivor item card to add a
survivor to the game it is placed at a non-colony location
of his choice rather than at the colony.

• When a survivor is bitten it is killed.

• The exiled player cannot spend food tokens to increase
his action die results, but may play food cards to increase
an action die result by 1 for each food card played rather
than carrying out the effect listed on the food card.

• Some card effects may kill a survivor.

• The exiled player cannot vote.

• When a survivor has 3 or more wound tokens it is
killed.

When a survivor is killed, remove its survivor standee
from the game board, decrease morale by 1, and place
its survivor card in the removed from game pile. If that
survivor had any cards equipped to it and that survivor
is at the colony those cards are added to the hand of the
player that controlled that survivor. If the survivor is
at any other location those cards are shuffled into that
location’s item deck.
If a player’s group leader is killed (or otherwise lost), she
must choose a survivor from her following and make it
her group leader.
If a player’s last remaining survivor would be killed (or
otherwise lost), that player immediately removes from
the game all cards in her hand, draws a new survivor
card, adds it to the game, and makes that survivor her
new group leader.
If a helpless survivor is killed (by the effects of a card or
as the result of a zombie overrun where there are only
helpless survivors in the location), remove a helpless
survivor token and reduce morale by 1.

Note: Some card effects remove survivors from the game. This is not
the same thing as killing a survivor. You do not lose morale when
removing a survivor unless the card directs you to.

14

• The colony does not lose morale when a survivor the
exiled player controls is killed.
• When the exiled player plays a card, instead of placing it
in the waste pile, he removes it from the game.

Important note: If at any time during the game there are 2 exiled
players and neither had a betrayal secret objective, morale
immediately drops to 0.

WINNING AND LOSING THE GAME
When the game ends for any reason, if a player has
completed his secret objective he wins. If he has not, he
loses. Some players may win in a game that other players
lost; there can be multiple winners. It is also possible
for everyone to lose if no one has completed his secret
objective when the game ends.
The game can end in a variety of ways:
• If the morale track reaches 0 the game ends immediately.
Do not check to see if the main objective has been
completed.
• If the round track reaches 0 the game ends immediately.
Do not check to see if the main objective has been
completed.
• The main objective is completed.

VOTING
During the game players may be given the option to
vote with a thumbs up or down, either because a player
initiated a vote to exile or because a crossroads card called
for a vote to be cast. Players may take time to deliberate
before casting their vote. Once players are ready to vote,
count down from 3, with every player simultaneously
casting his vote on 0.

CARD TEXT
When a card effect contradicts the rulebook, the card effect
takes precedence. If 2 game effects would ever seem to
trigger simultaneously, the first player decides in which
order they will resolve. An item card cannot be played to
interrupt an effect currently taking place.

Example: A medicine card cannot be played to prevent a wound,
it can only be played after receiving a wound, so if a survivor
receives their third wound they cannot be saved by playing a
medicine card, they will be killed.

ROLEPLAYING, SECRET OBJECTIVES
AND GAME BALANCE
In Dead of Winter each player takes on the role of a
survivor of the zombie apocalypse. That survivor leads
a group of other likeminded survivors. That group of
survivors is a part of a larger colony of survivors who are
all trying to live through a harsh winter in a broken world.
Each player starts the game with a secret objective. That
secret objective represents the psychological bearing, or
secret aspirations, of that player and her following. Most
players are driven to see the colony succeed but they also
have other compulsions that run so deep that they too
must be achieved.
Betrayal secret objectives represent a survivor who is
actively working against the colony. An exiled secret
objective represents the reaction of that group of survivors
to being exiled. Some secret objectives may be more
difficult to complete than others.

GAMEPLAY VARIANTS
CO-OP VARIANT
Players may choose to play the game cooperatively. Use the
hardcore side of the main objective card and do not assign
secret objectives. Each player’s only objective is to complete
the main objective. Players cannot vote to exile
a player. During setup, remove from the game
every card showing the non co-op symbol on
Non Co-op symbol
the bottom right corner of the card.

2 PLAYER VARIANT
Follow the same rules as the Co-Op Variant. When setting
up each player receives 7 starting item cards instead of 5
and receives 4 survivors and keeps 3 of them instead of
keeping only 2 of them.

BETRAYER VARIANT
During the setup players may choose to add only 1 nonbetrayal secret objective per player rather than 2, greatly
increasing the odds of a betrayer.
WE NEED MORE SAMPLES

HARDCORE VARIANT

SET UP
MORALE STARTS AT 6.
ROUND TRACK STARTS AT 5.
Add 3 zombies to all non-colony locations.

Instead of playing with the standard
side of the main objective, players
may choose to play the normal game
but use the hardcore side of the main
objective for a greater challenge.

PLAYER ELIMINATION VARIANT

VICTORY
Every time a zombie is killed roll a
die.
If it is a 4 or higher place a zombie
token
on this main objective card. Accumulate
3 zombies on this main objective for
each
player that started the game.
At the start of the game read
section MO10 on page 17.

TIME
SHORT

Hardcore side

Players may choose to play the game with
the player elimination variant. If a
player’s last remaining survivor would be
killed (or otherwise lost), remove from
the game all cards in
her hand. That player
is out of the game.

“You’re all idiots. Worse than that,
you’re dead idiots. Sure, I know how
it goes, each one of you’s a link in a
chain and blah, blah, blah. Well, all it
takes is one weak link in a chain for the
whole thing to fail. So good luck to you. You
all hold hands and sing your campfire songs,
but as soon as you trust the wrong person
to the wrong task, you’ll be eating each other
like the rest of the dead freaks out there.”

MAIN OBJECTIVE STORIES
M01 – X Weeks of Darkness
January 30th
This place is as dead as the things that hunt us. When
we formed the colony here, we thought we could live
off the town for years. But we misjudged what this
place had to offer. I can only assume it’s been hit by
other survivors and much of the goods and supplies we
should have been able to find are in short supply. Canned
goods, ammunition, fuel… everything we need is in
conspicuously small quantities. We need to move on, but
it’s just too cold. So we wait, praying for the weather to
let up so we can get the convoy rolling again, and start the
miserable search all over again. It seems like each time I’m
ready to eat a bullet, a new crisis appears, and suddenly I’m
fighting as if living is the only thing that matters.

M02 – Kill Them
January 15th
I refused to believe it at first, but the proof is there for
everyone to see. Twenty four hours has passed and Mel
still hasn’t risen. Sure the bites killed him, but they were
grotesquely severe. What’s important is they lacked the
juice to bring him back. Optimism is raging through
the colony like fire in a dry forest. We were already
wondering why the ranks of the dead seemed to be
thinning. Could our wildest hopes have come to pass?
Has whatever force that animated the corpses finally left
or died off? Should this be true, it changes everything.
If we can only kill those dead that shamble through the
town and around our walls, we might be able to spend
the rest of our lives in peace. Finally! I’m not afraid to
die fighting, but I don’t want to die and become the very
enemy I fought.

M03 – Find a Cure
December 20th
I sit here in silent shock. Could the answer be so simple?
Has our great species been brought to the edge of
extinction by a mutation of one of its simplest and oldest
viruses? If there are gods, surely they are laughing at us
now. Or at least they laughed at each moment in my life
when I failed to wash my hands. But what next? I need
a better lab. And supplies. I need to rally the others and
have them bring me everything they can. At the very least
I think I can immunize us, but even better, I think I might

16

be able to eradicate this plague in one fell airborne swoop.
I think back to that summer when I, drunk on youth and
love, considered staying in Italy and saying to hell with
finishing med school. How horrifying to think that a
cheating Italian boyfriend may have been a critical factor
in ending the greatest catastrophe to mankind!

M04 – Home Sweet Home
February 5th
All of our hard work has rewarded us more than I could
have hoped. Yesterday this was a refugee camp, and today
it’s an honest-to-God town. When people call it the
Colony, there’s no bitter irony in their voices, and that
speaks volumes. Only problem is, all of our hard work
has brought down a swarm of the dead upon us. Each day
brings new invaders to our walls, and they wander the
streets in town waiting for a living morsel to present itself.
If we can just figure out a way to kill this swarm, build up
our defenses and hopefully stop attracting more of them.
Sure, we’ll probably be dealing with stragglers for the rest
of our days, but anything would be better than the horde
we’re dealing with now.

M05 – Raiding Party
November 13th
Winter will be upon us before we know it, and we don’t
want to be here when it arrives. The town doesn’t seem
to have been looted much – they must have been hit hard.
We’ll set up a camp here, then hunker down and see what
we can find. We’ll need to move quickly, and not just
because of the weather. The dead seem to have caught
wind of our presence, and we see more and more each day.
If we lose people or waste supplies fighting those freaks
off, then this whole raid will be for nothing. Our primary
target for the search is fuel, but personally I’m hoping
medical supplies are abundant. If I don’t get this bite
treated soon, someone’s going to notice. Already I’ve got
a light fever that won’t go away, and once I start to sweat I
just can’t stop. All I need is some antibiotics or something.
I just know it. There’s no way I’m going out like those
other fools. I won’t let it happen.

M06 – Leave it all Behind
February 21st
It’s us or them now. I hate that it’s come this – I really do.
But our species isn’t going to survive without staring down
some terrible and hard truths. There’s a core group of us
and then there are the tagalongs. The core group makes all
the tough calls. It does all the hard work. The tagalongs
seem to just be there to eat our food and complain about
their inconveniences. Screw them. I say when it’s time
to go we leave behind the bickering fools who think
every decision deserves a debate and a vote. I say we
ditch the moaners who don’t appreciate the concept of a
meritocracy. Of course they don’t like that idea – they don’t
do anything. Well my mind is made up, and I know the
others will agree. We just need to make sure we act quickly
when the opportunity presents itself.

M07 – Stockpile
December 16th
This morning I stood on the watchtower (I still can’t
believe the thing hasn’t collapsed) and looked out at the
town. I pretended I couldn’t see the dead that staggered
through the streets, and it seemed lovely to me. Fog was
rising from the ground in ghostlike wisps, and the crisp
air that filled my lungs felt magnificent. I don’t want to
leave this place. Winter will be hard, but I’m already
dreaming of what spring will bring. Maybe I’m a fool to
find inspiration in the season where the Earth seems to
wither and die, but it’s always felt like starting over to me.
Now is the time to hunker down and gather all the food we
can. Now is when we build big walls our enemies cannot
overcome. The snow shall melt and everything that’s
green will flourish and bloom again, and when it does,
Spring shall find us not just alive but thriving.

M08 – Winter Has Come
November 28th
We’ve been caught with our pants down just like I
warned them. Anyone willing to keep their eyes open
could have seen the warning signs. Early morning
frosts. Rapidly changing weather. It was just a matter
of time. Now winter is here and up to now we’ve only
been concerning ourselves with food. The generators can
keep us alive but they’re useless without fuel. Yesterday
one of the kids offered to drive into town to scavenge,
and it was all I could do not to slap him. Drive? Doesn’t
that use fuel? Try walking – it will keep you warm at

least. God help me, it’s like the parable of the Ant and the
Grasshopper, only in this scenario the ants will die right
alongside their lazy companions.

M09 – Too Many Mouths
February 10th
Is today Groundhog’s Day? I can’t remember anymore.
Weird how hunger lets one dwell on such trivial thoughts.
Shouldn’t every brain cell be conserved right now? The
canned goods ran out a week ago, and the grains followed
soon after. The chickens are gone and so is the last of the
venison. We’re living off what scraps we find in town, but
they aren’t enough. I’ve never thought myself an evil man,
but God help me, my thoughts are dark of late. I know I’m
not the only one. There just isn’t enough food to go around,
and it’s hard not to feel bitter when it has to be shared with
people who don’t pull their own weight. These thoughts
are wrong. I know that. It’s no one’s fault that the skills
they possess belong to another world. Another time. Our
intellectual capacity is what separates us from animals,
yet when our most basic needs cannot be met, it’s hard not
think and act like animals.

M10 – We Need More Samples
January 25th
As if the colony needed to smell even worse! Now we’re
storing corpses in the sheds where we once kept our
plentiful food stores. God, what I wouldn’t give to taste
a carrot again. You-know-who has on her bossy boots
once more. I didn’t like doctors before the world ended,
and I don’t like them now. She says studying the bodies
might help her identify how to stop the plague. Yeah, right.
Better to spend time figuring out the quickest, cheapest
way to commit suicide. But whatever. Everyone else is
excited to help, and maybe that’s the real value of this
little project. All this “research” will do is tell us what we
already know – the dead come back and try to eat you.
Whoopty-freakin’-do. Still, if Her Royal Highness does
come up with a cure, I’d better be first in line to get it.

BETRAYAL STORIES
S11 – Gluttony Betrayal
Each morning I stand naked in front of the mirror and
drink in the sight of my body. I’ve noted the leanness in
the faces of the others or the visible ribs along their flanks.
They eat enough to survive, but everyone is hungry, and
though I cannot explain it, that fact excites me. Each night
I uncover my secret hoard and just stare at it. Sometimes
I sample these stolen morsels, but of course I can’t eat
too much or everyone will know. I revel in the thought
that my belly is filled while everyone else’s growls with
hunger. When I look in the mirror, I lovingly caress my
flesh; joyously touching those parts of myself that look so
plump and prosperous. I adore my love handles and the
slight paunch I’ve been nurturing. Such a luxury, and I
thrill that it comes at the expense of my neighbors. I have
while they do not, and I find that achingly exquisite.

S12 – Runaway Betrayal
Dear friends,
If you hadn’t figured out I was missing, well, now you
know. Words cannot express how terrible I feel about
cutting out on you like this, but I hope you’ll forgive me.
I’d like to tell you my actions are governed by deeply held
convictions or something, but really I’m just a coward.
And I’ve been scared lately. This colony is barely holding
together. In the past weeks I’ve noticed a lot of weaknesses
in our setup here, and it scared me. I suppose I could have
said something, maybe helped come up with solutions, but
I think it’s best to just have some “me time” right now, you
know? Nothing personal – I think you’re a great bunch of
human beings. I love you guys so much!

you can do it again. Or you’ll die. Either way, I’m good. So
what we need now is for everyone to form a line so you can
be searched before you’re taken to the gates. Don’t get so
excited. We’re not monsters. We’ll let you keep your clothes.

S14 – All for One Betrayal
You idiots never had a hope of surviving. The only reason
any of you are alive is you got lucky, or someone smarter
and stronger like me saved you. I’ve wanted to laugh
each time you talked about setting up barricades or going
out to forage. What a waste of effort! It’s only a matter
of time before this place falls, and man it’s coming. So
I’ve stockpiled some stuff, and now it’s time to get out of
here. What? Oh please. Man, I knew someone would say
that. Sure my taking this stuff is probably going to hasten
the colony’s collapse, but I’m not going to feel bad about
something that was going to happen anyway. That isn’t
my fault and this is not my doing. I bet any one of you
would have done the same thing already if you morons
were only smart enough to think of it. Now… step away
from the truck or I’ll show you how dangerous I am with
this thing. I’m done letting you live off my hard work.

S15 – Accept Your Fate Betrayal

P.S. I had to cut the eastern fences with bolt cutters to get
out, so there’s probably a bunch of zombies getting in that
way right now, or something. Just FYI.

Only now do you all understand the doom laid upon our
species. I tried to tell you it was hopeless, but I guess you
wanted to squander what was left of your lives on hard
labor. The colony was just a child’s daydream. Surely in
your hearts you knew it wasn’t sustainable? Nothing could
be in the face of complete annihilation. The dead will
always keep coming, and the few of us left on this planet
will always be swelling their ranks. It is best to go and
seek death now in the manner most fitting for you. Me? I
shall just lie here and wait. To do anything more would be
embarrassingly pointless.

S13 – Take Over Betrayal

S16 – Trigger Happy Betrayal

First of all, I’d like everyone here to give themselves a hand.
Truly, this was a group effort. Great job everyone – nice
hustle. The colony couldn’t be more perfect now. Lots
of defense, plenty of food – everything me and my crew
need to ensure our comfort while we wait out the zombie
apocalypse. Now if you don’t mind, as the old saying goes,
you don’t have to go home but you can’t stay here. Oh, don’t
look so glum. You guys did a bang-up job here and I’m sure

18

Come out, come out, wherever you are. I killed most of
you already, and those who are left can’t hide. You see, I
didn’t shoot anyone in the head. Your precious neighbors
and loved ones will be moving again soon, and you’ll find
this colony has become just another death trap. It’s the
zombies or me kids! You have no one but yourselves to
blame. I couldn’t have stockpiled all these weapons if you
had just taken a moment to notice me. To recognize my

hard work. Didn’t you see all the things I contributed to the
community? If you had just paid attention I wouldn’t have
been able to build this arsenal. But oh no, you all just ran
around like chickens with your heads cut off, jumping from
crisis to crisis. Our brave self-appointed colony leaders!
Psh. Just another exclusive clique that doesn’t care about
all the other people it chews up and spits out. Because it’s
your story, right? The rest of us are just supporting actors!
Isn’t that what you think? Well surprise, it turns out it’s my
story, and this one’s all about revenge. So I’ll say it again.
Come out, come out, wherever you are…

S17 – Cult Leader Betrayal
The dawn of a new age is upon us! In the Old Testament,
God sent down his angels to deliver punishment to the
flock. But when two thousand years passed, the flock
believed the Shepherd did not exist. They claimed he
was mythological, and so they wallowed in their earthly
comforts and sins. But what is a thousand years to God?
What could even ten thousand years be to the Almighty?
Now the Shepherd has turned his eye back to his flock and
found them sick with corruption, and so he does what any
good caretaker would do: he culls the diseased so that the
healthy might live. Make no mistake my disciples! The
dead that roam across this country are the damned, and
they seek out those sheep bereft of repentance. Our Lord
does not wish to kill his children – indeed he loves them,
even as he strikes them down. But he shall not suffer the
poisoning of our souls any longer. And so we welcome the
ravenous dead, those wretches that our Lord found wanting,
knowing it is a just punishment for an unjust world.

S18 – Serial Killers Betrayal
Before the outbreak I lived in terror of being caught. I’m
not a sadist I don’t think. I don’t get off on seeing people in
pain, or anything sick like that. It just fascinates me is all. I
think I’m kind of like a scientist. I just really need to study
people in those precious final moments. See how they react
physically and emotionally to pain… see how they deal
with the realization that they’re going to die. I think God
understood what I needed when he made the world end.
There’s suffering all around me now: the pain of manual
labor, the pangs of hunger, and of course the violence
caused by the dead. And now so many people in the colony
have died that I don’t think I have to just watch anymore
– there aren’t enough of them to stop us and we’ve got the
element of surprise on our side. And surprise does make for
especially fascinating studies. Everyone here is going to die
in the time and manner of my choosing. I’m very excited –
there’s going to be so much to watch and learn.

S19 – Mad Scientist Betrayal
They’re almost perfect, you know? The dead, I mean.
They can not only withstand any trauma save that to the
brain, but they will attempt locomotion no matter the
amount of damage to their trunk or extremities. Their
only flaws are that they are not controllable, and of course
their utter lack of intellectual capacity. Until now. Let me
introduce you to two of our fallen comrades. Before my
experiments they would have been doomed to be mindless
cannibals that slowly rotted away. But my engineered
version of the so-called zombie virus prohibits 35% of the
damage done to the brain during the incubation period.
Our friends here are only suffering from the standard
cellular decay that all living creatures experience, and
many of their brain functions have been left intact. Oh,
they’re drooling automata to be sure, but they are still able
to follow rudimentary commands, all while remaining
completely without fear. So lay down your weapons you
fools. You are too late. I secreted my gZ3 compound in the
drinking water… yesterday morning. Haven’t you noticed
how performance at the colony started suffering then?
Have you not found my words harder to follow the longer
I talk? We have come to the end of your adventure, and all
of you now belong to me.

S20 – Obsessed Betrayal
It’s just you and me now. When I first saw you I
understood that we were meant to be together. It was an
epiphany of almost religious significance. Don’t you get it?
You were made for me. Every nuance of your personality,
every feature on that lovely face – all of it came to be
so that you would be perfect just for me. So you can
understand my frustration when I felt, nay, witnessed your
love being directed at everyone but me. You must think
I’m blind to not see it. But what I cannot fathom is, why?
Do you derive some perverse pleasure out of denying
your purpose in this world? Is it cruelty? Or maybe, and
this is what I hope, it’s all some sort of test. Well here we
are my love. It’s just you and me, and a little something to
make it clear there are no more places for you to run. The
others you so disgustingly leered at and planned secret
trysts with? Dead or gone. I did that. I did it for you. For
us! Always for us! So here we are, at the end of the test.
So please stop your incessant weeping, and embrace our
new life together. Just think – you will never have another
moment in your life in which I am not right by your side.
